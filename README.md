# Tech 201 CI/CD

## DevOps Culture and CICD
DevOps, in a nutshell, is a culture that combines software development and IT operations, and have them work collaboratively throughout the software development life-cylce through development to production. This is achieved through a set of practices that automate the processes between software development and IT teams, so that they can build , test, and release software faster.

## What is CI, CD and CDE?
CI/CD is considered the backbone of DevOps practices and automation, it plays a vital role in DevOps culture, growing numbers of companies are able to release their software in minutes with the adoption of CI/CD practices.

CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. CI/CD serves as the solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for develoment and operations teams  (AKA "integration hell"). Speifically, CI/CD introduces ongoing automation and continuous monitoring throughout the lifecyle of apps, from integration testing phases to delivery and deployment. Taken together, these connected practices are often referred to as the CICD pipeline.

Lets look specifically at what each of these are:

### Continuous Integration (CI)
Continuous integration is where developers merge/commit code into a centralised repository, with a fully automated build and test process used to assess whether the newly merged code is correct. This allows developers to receive feedback within minutes, this allows them to avoid integration (or merge) hell that would usually happen when developers merge their code much further down the line, which could become very time consuming and expensive!
